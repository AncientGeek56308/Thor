<h3 align="center">Thor TWEeT #4: Insert full name of object under mouse</h3>
<p>This week's TWEeT is <strong>Insert full name of object under mouse</strong> (the longer the tool name, the narrower it's focus)</p>
<p>This tool simplifies the task of inserting a reference to another object in the same form or class you are editing (VCXs / SCXs only).</p>
<p>The directions are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor where you want the reference to be inserted in your code window. The focus must be on this method.
</li><li>Move the mouse over the object you want to refer to. </li><li>Use the hot key you have assigned to <strong>Insert full name of object under mouse.</strong>
</li></ol>
<p>Two important parts of this to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>The focus must on the code window, not the form or class you are editing. </li><li>This tool <u>only works by using a hot key</u>, since it reads what is under the mouse when you execute it.
</li></ol>
<p>You may have problems with remembering so many hot keys (at least I do), particularly for tools like this that you might not be using with great regularity.&nbsp; The way that I handle this is to add the tool to the

Thor Tool Bar</a>. When I need it, the tooltip shows me the hot key.</p>
<p>This tool also works at run time. Place the cursor into the Command Window (instead of a code window) and the tool will paste into it a reference to the object under the mouse in an executing form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a closely related tool named <strong>Inspect properties of object under mouse</strong> (written by Andy Kramek) that also works at run time. Run this tool the same way and it pops up a MessageBox that displays the major properties of the object
 under the mouse.</p>
<p>Thor provides a neat tool for browsing the contents of objects and collections,
<strong>Object and Collection Inspector</strong> -- more on that in next week's TWEeT.</p>

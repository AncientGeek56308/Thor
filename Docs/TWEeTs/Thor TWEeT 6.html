<h3 align="center">Thor TWEeT #6: Creating Properties and Methods (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Thor provides quite a range of tools to create new properties and methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple of common tools that use familiar techniques for creating new properties and methods:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PEM Editor</strong> (about which no more will be said) </li><li><strong>Add Property/Method</strong>, the diminutive offspring of <strong>PEM Editor</strong><em>,
</em>which uses this simple form: </li></ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=vfpx&DownloadId=769023"><img title="image001" src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=vfpx&DownloadId=769024" alt="image001" width="304" height="257" border="0" style="padding-top:0px; padding-left:0px; display:inline; padding-right:0px; border:0px"></a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these tools offer features not available from the standard New Property and New Method:</p>
<ul>
<li>The form is modeless and you can easily switch between adding properties and methods.
</li><li>MemberData is automatically updated if the name contains any uppercase characters.
</li><li>If you are creating a new property:
<ul>
<li>There is an option to set the initial value of the property based on the first character of the property name (&lsquo;c&rsquo; = Character, &lsquo;n&rsquo; = Numeric, etc). Default = ON
</li><li>You can create a <a href="https://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PlugIns">Plug-In</a> to use some other method for assigning the initial values (such as using the second character)
</li></ul>
</li><li>If you are creating a new method:
<ul>
<li>You can open it immediately for editing. </li><li>You can create a <a href="https://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PlugIns">Plug-In</a> that will populate the header of the newly created method.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>When you use either of these tools, you are following the long-established two-step pattern where the process of creating the new property/method is distinct from using a reference to it.</p>
<p>In next week's TWEeT on this topic, I will demonstrate tools that establish a new pattern: you can create a property or method as you refer to it.&nbsp; Using these tools tends to provide less interruption to your programming flow, as you can create new
 properties and methods &quot;on the fly&quot;.</p>

<h3 align="center">Thor TWEeT #8: Creating Properties and Methods (Part 3)</h3>
<p>This is the third and last in a series of TWEeTs showcasing the various ways that you can create properties and methods.</p>
<p>There is one more Thor tool that creates methods: <strong>Extract to Method</strong>.</p>
<p>Use this tool when you have a block of method code (from a VCX or SCX) that you want to remove from the current code window and save into a new method.</p>
<p>The steps to do so are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight the lines of code you want to extract and move </li><li>Invoke tool <strong>Extract to Method</strong>. </li></ul>
<p>This pops up a form where you can enter the name of the method to be created:</p>
<p><a href="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=vfpx&DownloadId=775188"><img title="SNAGHTML8088be4" src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=vfpx&DownloadId=775189" alt="SNAGHTML8088be4" width="484" height="256" border="0" style="padding-top:0px; padding-left:0px; display:inline; padding-right:0px; border:0px"></a></p>
<p>When you click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;, the following steps are performed:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new method is created. </li><li>The code window for the new method is opened </li><li>The code you had highlighted in the original method is pasted into the new code window.
</li><li>The highlighted code is removed from the original code window. </li><li>A reference to the new method is pasted into the original code window. </li></ol>
<p>Note as well the comments in the form that comes up:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can specify a result for your created method; the last line of the method returns that result and that result is also assigned in the original code window.
</li><li>You can specify parameters to your created method;&nbsp; an LParameters statement is inserted at the beginning of the new code window and the parameters are used in the call in the original code window.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Extract to Method</strong> works in code windows from VCXs and SCXs, but not PRGs.</p>

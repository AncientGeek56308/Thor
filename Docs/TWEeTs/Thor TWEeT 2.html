<p>This week's Thor TWeeT is <strong>Set Object Size and Position.</strong></p>
<p>This tool provides enhanced capabilities to the Format menu pad in the FoxPro system menu, shown here:</p>

<p><strong>Set Object Size and Position</strong> displays a form that includes all of the features from the Format menu, except for Snap to Grid and Set Grid Scale. In addition,</p>
<ul>
<li>there are controls to change the top/left/height/width of the currently selected control(s), either one pixel at a time or by a specified step size.
</li><li>vertical and horizontal spacing may be changed either one pixel at a time or by a specified step size.
</li><li>there's an un-do button to reverse any changes made since the form received focus.
</li></ul>
<p>The form's size and position is persistent from one use to another. The form is also dockable, and the six containers re-arrange themselves as the width of the form changes, allowing for various desirable docking combinations.&nbsp;</p>

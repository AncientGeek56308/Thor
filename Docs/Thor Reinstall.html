<h3>Installing an updated version of Thor</h3>
<p><br>
To install an updated version of Thor, simply unzip the installation zip file on top of the current version of Thor.
<br>
<br>
Do <u>not</u> install Thor in a new folder or erase the Thor sub-folder, as you will lose any menus, hot keys, etc, that you have created.
<br>
<br>
This will replace Thor.APP, and will not modify or delete any of the settings and tools that you have installed.
<br>
<br>
Any updates necessary for the new version will be automatically installed the first time that you run Thor thereafter,

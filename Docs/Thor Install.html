<h3 align="center">First-Time and Manual Installation of Thor</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Starting with Thor Version 1.1, updates to Thor can be obtained by using
<a href="http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Thor%20One-Cick%20Update">One-Click Update of Thor</a><strong>.&nbsp;
</strong>This page applies to the initial installation of Thor or should it happen that the One-Click Update is not working.</p>
<h4 align="center"><strong>Choosing an installation folder</strong></h4>
<p>Thor must be installed in a permanent folder; it creates some folders and tables which must always be available. It is suggested that it be installed in a folder that you regularly back up.
<br>
<br>
There are two different strategies for selecting an installation folder for Thor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install it in a common folder (such as in your path), so that Thor.App can be easily accessed
</li><li>Install it in its own separate folder, and then use RunThor.PRG (see below) to access Thor.App&nbsp;
</li></ol>

<h4 align="center"><strong>Installing Thor</strong></h4>
<p>After you have downloaded the Zip file into its installation folder, do the following:
<br>
</p>
<pre>     Clear All
     Do Thor.APP</pre>
<p><br>
This will</p>
<ul>
<li>create a folder named Thor in the installation folder </li><li>create some sub-folders and files in that folder </li><li>update the VFP system menu (by adding a menu pad for Thor) </li><li>run <a href="http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Thor%20One-Cick%20Update">
&quot;Check for Updates&quot;</a> so that you it can download and install <a href="http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PEM%20Editor%20IDE%20Tools">
PEM Editor</a> and <a href="http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Thor%20Repository">
The Thor Repository</a>, which are necessary components for Thor </li><li>and open the Thor form. </li></ul>
<p>Note the installation does not affect VFP in any other way (it does not SET any variables, modify foxcode, etc.) and may safely be repeated as many times as desired.</p>
